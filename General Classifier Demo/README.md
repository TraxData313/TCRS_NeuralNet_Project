### INFO:
- The Classifier Demo is an example of a Neural Network, that uses a trivial Local learning rule within the standard NN connection topology
- The Demo demonstraits how this kind of network can solve the standard classification problem, and points out where and why the Confusion would occure with this simplistic design

### Basic tests:
- Those are 3 basic tests that show the power of the classifier and point out where the confusion in the demo version would occure
- Open the demo_review_part1.html in your browser to view the demo
- Download the files and run demo_review_part1.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to test changing the parameters
- Or download the files and run the demo_review_part1_inCLI.py to run the test in your OS CLI

### Real-Life Tests:
- Famous categorise wines test
- Will the bank client churn test
