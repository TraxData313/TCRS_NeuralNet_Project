### INFO:
- The Classifier Demo is an example of a Neural Network, that uses a simple Local learning rule within the standard NN connection topology
- The Demo demonstraits how this kind of network can solve the standard classification problem, and points out where and why the Confusion would occure with this simplistic design
- When equiped with the advanced local learning algorithm and the complex "heavilty-connected" topology, the Classifier can achieve smooth increasing learning curve, even on the hardest tasks
- Now the research is shifted to implementing the local rules into indentical small circuits, making the first hot-scalable artificial brain (more neurons - more intelect) and experimenting with "lighter" topologies

### Basic tests (part 1):
- Those are 3 basic tests that show the power of the classifier and point out where the confusion in the demo version would occure
- Open the demo_review_part1.html in your browser to view the demo
- Download the files and run demo_review_part1.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to test changing the parameters
- Or download the files and run the demo_review_part1_inCLI.py to run the test in your OS CLI
- NOTE: To perform the tests yourself you will need the ClassifierDemo.py module. I will not post it here, so please contact me @ antongeorgiev313@gmail.com if you are interested!

### Real-Life Tests (part 2):
- Famous categorise wines test
- Will the bank client churn test
