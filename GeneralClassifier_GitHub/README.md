### Information:
- Here is the latest version of the General Classifier Neural Network, as simulated in python, having the latest network connection topology and the latest version of the Local learning algorithm
- To do basic tests on the network run tester.py from the same folder as the networkMod.py and utils.py modules
- There are also two more tests included: wine_test.py (on wine.data) and churn_test.py (on Churn_Modelling.csv)
- The General_Classifier_test.ipynb contains the churn_test.py and compares it with the keras ANN Adam done in Jupyter Notebook format
