## The Predictor:
- The Predictor is a continuous data Regression System
- The predictor is still a prototype system, and in active research. It’s “future-predictive” power combined with the “reaction” and learning power of the General Classifier, would make the Super-Reinforcement Learning Platform
- The Predictor takes “timestamps” of continuous data and predicts the next one
- Once the next prediction is made, the Predictor simulates itself with the new prediction as the new input to predict the yet next input
- This process is repeated for N times, depending how “long” of a prediction is needed
- Micro and Macro-based Rating systems make sure that the best prediction is made and that every prediction “timestamp” has a proper accuracy probability to it
