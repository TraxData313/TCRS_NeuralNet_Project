## Progress:
### 15.May.2019:
- Implementaition roadmap is compleated, today I'm starting to methodically build the first neuron patch
- Created the initial test board with two Arduino Nanos
- One nano is meanth to be the clock and the other is a neuron patch
- Each nano has 3 inputs and 3 outputs initially
- Test1 - 11_IOtest.txt: made sure the IO connections are working alright
- Test2 - ClockSync.txt: made sure the neuron patch follows the bool clock signal
